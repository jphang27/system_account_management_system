# system_account_management_system
Was able to create an OOP and FP User Account Managment System.
Next goal is to try to implement it in a way where, I can chain my objects.

OOP ex) User1.signUp().signIn().signOut();

FP ex) User.signUp(User.signIn(User.signOut)));

My idea or intuition is probably to return something from each of my function and it will allow me to chain it.
